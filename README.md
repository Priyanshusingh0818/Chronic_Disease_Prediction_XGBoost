# Chronic Kidney Disease Prediction using XGBoost

This project utilizes **XGBoost** to predict the likelihood of **Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD)** based on a dataset with various health-related features. XGBoost is renowned for its efficiency and performance in handling large datasets and complex models.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to develop a predictive model using XGBoost that can accurately classify whether a patient has Chronic Kidney Disease or not. The model is trained on a dataset containing various health indicators and features related to kidney function.

## Functionalities

- **CKD Prediction**: Predicts the presence or absence of Chronic Kidney Disease based on health data.
- **Efficient Processing**: Leverages XGBoost’s gradient boosting techniques for effective classification.
- **Performance Evaluation**: Assesses model performance through accuracy metrics and detailed classification reports.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Optional step for optimizing model performance using techniques like GridSearchCV.

## Dataset

- **Content**: The dataset includes features related to kidney health, such as blood pressure, age, and other relevant metrics.
- **Purpose**: Used to train and test the XGBoost model for accurate CKD prediction.
- **Source**: The dataset can be sourced from publicly available health datasets or medical records.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Priyanshusingh0818/ckd-xgboost.git
    cd ckd-xgboost
    ```

2. **Install required dependencies**:

    ```bash
    pip install xgboost numpy pandas scikit-learn
    ```

## Usage

1. **Data Preparation**: Load and preprocess the CKD dataset.
2. **Model Training**: Train the XGBoost model on the prepared dataset.
3. **Evaluation**: Evaluate the model’s performance using test data and review accuracy metrics.
4. **Tuning** (Optional): Optimize model performance using hyperparameter tuning techniques.

## Results

The XGBoost model aims to achieve high accuracy in predicting Chronic Kidney Disease. The model's performance is validated through accuracy scores and classification reports, providing insights into its effectiveness.
